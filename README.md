# To-Do-List
This project is the rite of passage for every beginner. At the time this was very challenging project. If I were to go back I would make it more my own as I remember
constantly having to check the internet. I did learn a lot from this though because it itroduced me to new functions in js and expanded my knowledge of css exponentially.
